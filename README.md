Creating a game using JavaScript (also HTML and CSS)

## Checkers

Creating a two-player offline game of checkers. Opening `page.html` in the browser should start the game.
Currently, the game can handle movement of basic pieces. It does not yet have any "King" functionality.

### Fix Up

- After jump: can jump ? still turn : end turn
  - Can jump = is next to opponent & open space behind opponent
- Reached opposite end ? King : nothing
